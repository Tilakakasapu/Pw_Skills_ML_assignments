    "# Q1. What is Lasso Regression, and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "# Lasso Regression, short for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, is a linear regression technique that adds a penalty term to the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression cost function. The primary difference between Lasso Regression and other regression techniques (like Ridge Regression or OLS) is the type of penalty it applies:\n",
    "# L1 Regularization: Lasso adds the absolute values of the coefficients to the cost function. This encourages some coefficients to be exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection and simplifying the model.\n",
    "# Other key differences include its ability to perform automatic feature selection and its unique impact on coefficient magnitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2. What is the main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection?\n",
    "# The main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection is its ability to automatically identify and exclude irrelevant or less important features from the model. It does this by setting some coefficients to exactly zero. This feature selection capability makes Lasso particularly valuable when dealing with high-dimensional datasets, where not all predictors may be relevant.\n",
    "# Q3. How do you interpret the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model?\n",
    "# Interpreting coefficients in Lasso Regression is similar to interpreting coefficients in other linear regression techniques. Each coefficient represents the change in the dependent variable associated with a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable, assuming all other variables are held constant.\n",
    "# However, the unique aspect of Lasso Regression is that some coefficients may be exactly zero. When a coefficient is zero, it means that the corresponding feature has been excluded from the model, and it has no impact on the dependent variable.\n",
    "# Q4. What are the tuning parameters that can be adjusted in Lasso Regression, and how do they affect the model's performance?\n",
    "# In Lasso Regression, the main tuning parameter is often denoted as \n",
    "# λ (lambda). It controls the strength of the regularization and the degree of feature selection:\n",
    "# λ: A higher λ results in stronger regularization and more aggressive feature selection, as it increases the penalty for large coefficient values. A lower λ allows the model to retain more features and may lead to overfitting if too low.\n",
    "#Adjusting λ is crucial for finding the right balance between model complexity and accuracy. Cross-validation is commonly used to choose the optimal \n",
    "# λ value that maximizes model performance on unseen data.\n",
    "# Q5. Can Lasso Regression be used for non-linear regression problems? If yes, how?\n",
    "# Lasso Regression is inherently a linear regression technique and is best suited for linear relationships between predictors and the target variable. However, it can be used for non-linear regression problems with some modifications:\n",
    "# Feature Engineering: You can engineer non-linear features or transformations of existing features to capture non-linear relationships. These transformed features can then be used in Lasso Regression.\n",
    "# Polynomial Regression: By adding polynomial features (e.g., quadratic or cubic terms) to the dataset, you can model non-linear relationships with Lasso Regression.\n",
    "# Kernel Methods: You can use kernel methods like the kernel trick in Support Vector Machines to implicitly map data to a higher-dimensional space where linear models like Lasso may capture non-linear patterns.\n",
    "# While Lasso can handle some degree of non-linearity through these methods, for highly non-linear problems, other techniques like decision trees, random forests, or neural networks may be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q6. What is the difference between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression?\n",
    "# The primary difference between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression lies in the type of regularization penalty they apply:\n",
    "# Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization): Ridge adds the squares of the coefficients to the cost function. It reduces the magnitude of coefficients but does not force any coefficients to be exactly zero. Ridge is useful for mitigating multicollinearity and controlling overfitting.\n",
    "# Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization): Lasso adds the absolute values of the coefficients to the cost function. It encourages some coefficients to be exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection. Lasso is valuable for feature selection and sparsity.\n",
    "# Another difference is in the geometric interpretation of the regularization constraints. Ridge creates a circular constraint region, while Lasso creates a diamond-shaped constraint region, leading to differences in how they affect the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q7. Can Lasso Regression handle multicollinearity in the input features? If yes, how?\n",
    "# Yes, Lasso Regression can handle multicollinearity among input features. When features are highly correlated, Lasso tends to select one of them while setting the coefficients of the others to exactly zero. This reduces the impact of multicollinearity on the model because it effectively performs feature selection and retains a subset of relevant features.\n",
    "# In this way, Lasso helps to address multicollinearity by simplifying the model and selecting the most informative predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q8. How do you choose the optimal value of the regularization parameter (lambda) in Lasso Regression?\n",
    "# Choosing the optimal value of the regularization parameter \n",
    "# λ in Lasso Regression typically involves using techniques like cross-validation. Here's a simplified explanation:\n",
    "# You select a range of \n",
    "# λ values.\n",
    "# You split your dataset into training and validation sets.\n",
    "# For each  λ value, you train the Lasso Regression model on the training data and evaluate its performance on the validation data.\n",
    "# You choose the λ value that results in the best model performance on the validation data. This λ strikes the right balance between feature selection and model accuracy.\n",
    "# Cross-validation helps you find the λ value that maximizes model performance on unseen data.\n",
