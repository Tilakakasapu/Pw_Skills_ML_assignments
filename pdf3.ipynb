    "# ### Q1: What is Estimation Statistics? Explain point estimate and interval estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - **Estimation Statistics**: Estimation in statistics is the process of inferring the value of a population parameter based on a sample. It involves using sample data to provide an estimate of a population parameter (such as the mean or variance).\n",
    "  \n",
    "# - **Point Estimate**: A point estimate is a single value given as an estimate of an unknown population parameter. For example, if you have a sample mean of 50, then the point estimate for the population mean is 50.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - **Interval Estimate**: An interval estimate provides a range of values within which the true population parameter is likely to fall. This range is usually accompanied by a confidence level, such as a 95% confidence interval, indicating the degree of certainty that the true parameter lies within the interval.\n",
