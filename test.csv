Tuition is too high for many reasons, chiefly because colleges and universities for the most part compete to be all things to all people, so faculty and classroom space must constantly expand. Also, only the wealthy pay the 'rack rate' full tuition at the top institutions with decent endowments or state funding. Free tuition would increase two things: more marginally or unqualified applicants and proliferation of easy, feel good, study yourself courses and majors. The idea of substituting community service for standardized test scores and grades as a basis for admission will further dilute the seriousness of university scholarship.

And those who do not read newspapers and do not understand the issues, should preferably not vote.

If most voters had graduated from college, I doubt that we would see Cain or Perry as viable candidates.
