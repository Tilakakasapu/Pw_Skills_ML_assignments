    "# # #Data Encoding:\n",
    "# # Data encoding in the context of data science refers to the process of converting categorical data into a numerical format that can be used for analysis and modeling. Categorical data consists of categories, labels, or classes and is non-numeric in nature. Encoding categorical data is essential in data science because many machine learning algorithms and statistical techniques require numeric input data. Here's why data encoding is useful:\n",
    "# Label Encoding: Assigning a unique integer to each category. However, this method can imply ordinal relationships that may not exist in the data.\n",
    "# One-Hot Encoding: Creating binary columns for each category and representing the presence (1) or absence (0) of each category in a given sample. This method avoids imposing ordinal relationships but can lead to high dimensionality.\n",
    "# Ordinal Encoding: Assigning integers to categories based on their inherent order or meaning. This method is suitable for ordinal categorical variables with a natural ranking."

In such cases, nominal encoding can help reduce dimensionality by representing the categories with integers, making it more computationally efficient.\n",

One-hot encoding can significantly increase the dimensionality of your dataset, which may not be desirable, especially when dealing with limited data or resource constraints.\n",
